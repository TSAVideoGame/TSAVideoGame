/*
 * STATE
 *
 * A game state, like menu, game, pause
 *
 * State Data are basically variables,
 * but instead of names you need to use
 * an index, make enums if you want names
 * 
 * The data is also just an array of
 * whatever data type you want, preferably
 * a uint type that you cast into others
 *
 * Access state data by:
 *   state.data[index]
 *
 * States have updates and draws, input is not
 * handled
 *
 * The actual functions for create and destroy
 * are for initializing and destroying the struct,
 * while the callbacks are for when they are
 * created and destroyed on the stack.
 *
 * The state data persists in memory as long as
 * the state manager is active, but other data
 * can be created dynamically with the create
 * and destroy callbacks
 *
 * The create callback is called on a push,
 * and the destroy callback is called on a pop
